#Connect Four Game
This repository contains a Python implementation of the classic Connect Four game. Players take turns choosing a column to drop their colored chip, aiming to connect four of their chips either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game prompts players for board dimensions and lets them play against each other.

#Features
Customizable board dimensions to allow different game sizes.
Alternating turns between two players, represented by 'x' and 'o' chips.
Logic to detect and announce a winner when four chips of the same type are connected.
A draw condition when the board is filled without a winner.

#Usage
Run the connect_four() function in the provided Python script to start the game. Follow the on-screen prompts to set the board dimensions and take turns choosing columns to drop your chips. The game ends when a player connects four chips or when the board is filled without a winner.

Feel free to explore, modify, and enhance the code to suit your preferences or contribute to the project. Enjoy playing Connect Four!
